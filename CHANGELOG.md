# Changelog

Every change raises the patch version and is said here in short, the newest first.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-10-29

- A machine's lines gather ten seconds before they go to Logline: a batch every ten seconds, not
  an INSERT a line; Logline's own four containers carry `logline=off`, so the agent on its machine
  no longer sends it its own lines back; ClickHouse's own logs keep three days, and the four
  nothing reads are off (`config/clickhouse-logs.xml`).

## 1.0.1 — 2026-10-28

- The version goes up with every change, and this file says each change in short.

## 1.0.0

- Everything before this file.
