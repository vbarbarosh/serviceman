# Changelog

Every change raises the patch version and is said here in short, the newest first.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-10-29

- A machine not answering names the file its link carries meanwhile: how much was sent, how much
  the machine wrote and when its bytes last moved, on its page and in the log's
  remote_unanswered and remote_answering (`file= sent= taken= still=`).

## 1.0.3 — 2026-10-29

- A copy between machines whose bytes stand still for 30 s is cut and goes on by itself from
  where the disk says it stands, where it waited for Cancel; the line under it names the file on
  its way, read from the tar's headers, not "56 small files in one go".
- A machine whose calls wait past 10 s says "not answering" beside its name, its dot orange, and
  the log says once when it stops answering and once when it answers again.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-10-29

- A machine's lines gather ten seconds before they go to Logline: a batch every ten seconds, not
  an INSERT a line; Logline's own four containers carry `logline=off`, so the agent on its machine
  no longer sends it its own lines back; ClickHouse's own logs keep three days, and the four
  nothing reads are off (`config/clickhouse-logs.xml`).

## 1.0.1 — 2026-10-28

- The version goes up with every change, and this file says each change in short.

## 1.0.0

- Everything before this file.
